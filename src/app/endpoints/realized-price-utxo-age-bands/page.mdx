# Realized Price - UTXO Age Bands

The **Realized Price UTXO Age Bands** metric calculates the average acquisition price for Bitcoin held across different age cohorts. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This metric reveals the cost basis of different holder types by holding period, enabling analysis of which cohorts are in profit or loss and identifying potential support/resistance levels from specific holder groups.

### Interpretation

**High short-term realized prices** indicate recent buyers acquired at elevated levels, creating potential resistance as these holders lack significant gains and may sell on modest appreciation to recoup investments or cut losses if sentiment deteriorates.

**Low long-term realized prices** reveal veteran holders acquired at historically low levels, indicating substantial unrealized gains that provide both conviction through profit cushion and potential supply if these holders decide to take profits.

**Current price above cohort realized price** shows that specific age band maintains unrealized profits, suggesting reduced selling pressure from this cohort as holders enjoy gains and possess psychological comfort to maintain positions through volatility.

**Current price below cohort realized price** indicates that specific age band holds underwater positions, revealing potential capitulation risk from this cohort as extended losses increase psychological pressure to sell and recover remaining capital.

### Use Cases

This metric provides sophisticated insight into the profit/loss positions and potential behavior of different holder cohorts by revealing their average cost basis. Comparing current price to each cohort's realized price immediately reveals which holder types are profitable versus underwater, enabling targeted analysis of potential supply pressure or support. Short-term cohorts with high realized prices near current levels represent holders with minimal gains who are more likely to sell on modest appreciation, creating resistance zones around these cost basis levels. Conversely, long-term cohorts with low realized prices far below current levels represent strong hands with substantial gains less likely to panic sell, providing support even during corrections. During bull markets, tracking which cohorts are beginning to show underwater positions during pullbacks helps identify potential support levels, as cohorts transitioning from profit to loss often provide strong buying interest to defend their cost basis. The spread between short-term and long-term realized prices reveals profit heterogeneity across the holder base, with large spreads indicating substantial gains for veterans while recent buyers hold minimal profits. Rising realized prices across all bands during rallies confirms broad-based capital inflows at higher levels, strengthening fundamental support structure, while stagnant realized prices despite price appreciation warns of limited turnover and potential fragility. The metric also identifies generational cohort characteristics, with cohorts acquired during previous cycle peaks holding at elevated realized prices that may act as resistance during recovery attempts.
