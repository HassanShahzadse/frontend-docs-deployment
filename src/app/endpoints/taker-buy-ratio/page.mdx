## Understanding the metric

<Row>
  <Col>

<Properties>
  <Property name="taker_buy_ratio" type="number">
    The ratio of taker buy volume to total taker volume in perpetual swap
    markets, ranging from 0 to 1, representing the proportion of aggressive
    orders that are buys versus sells.
  </Property>

### Interpretation

**High taker buy ratio (above 0.55)** indicates aggressive buying dominates, revealing impatient bulls willing to lift offers and pay the spread for immediate long exposure, signaling strong bullish conviction and potential upward momentum.

**Low taker buy ratio (below 0.45)** demonstrates aggressive selling dominates, showing impatient bears hitting bids for immediate short exposure, signaling strong bearish conviction and potential downward momentum.

**Taker buy ratio near 0.50** suggests balanced aggression between buyers and sellers, indicating neutral sentiment without clear directional bias as neither bulls nor bears demonstrate urgency.

**Rising taker buy ratio** reveals growing buying aggression relative to selling, indicating strengthening bullish sentiment as more traders become willing to aggressively enter long positions by taking liquidity.

### Use Cases

This metric provides real-time insight into directional sentiment through derivatives order flow, revealing which side demonstrates greater urgency and conviction. Taker orders represent impatient traders willing to pay the spread for immediate execution rather than waiting passively with limit orders, making taker flow a strong indicator of directional conviction. High taker buy ratios indicate bulls are more aggressive than bears, suggesting upward momentum as buying pressure intensifies from traders demanding immediate long exposure. This aggressive buying often precedes or accompanies rallies, as urgent demand lifts prices when takers exhaust available sell liquidity. Conversely, low taker buy ratios reveal bears dominating aggression, with urgent selling pressure driving prices down as impatient shorts hit available buy liquidity. The metric also identifies sentiment shifts through ratio changes, with transitions from low to high ratios signaling momentum reversals as aggression shifts from bears to bulls. Extreme readings above 0.60 or below 0.40 indicate highly one-sided sentiment that can signal either strong trends or exhaustion conditions depending on context and duration. Comparing taker buy ratio to price action reveals conviction quality, with price advances accompanied by high ratios confirming strong demand while advances with low ratios warn of weak buying interest. The metric proves particularly valuable for short-term trading, as taker flow responds quickly to news and sentiment shifts, providing leading or confirming signals for directional moves.
