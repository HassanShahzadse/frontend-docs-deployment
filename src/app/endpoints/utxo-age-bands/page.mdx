# UTXO Age Bands

The **UTXO Age Bands** metric distributes the active Bitcoin supply across age cohorts, revealing how holdings are stratified by time unmoved. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This metric identifies the proportion of supply held by different holder types through age-based segmentation, with young bands indicating active traders and old bands representing committed long-term holders.

### Interpretation

**High young band supply** indicates substantial recently-moved Bitcoin, revealing active trading or distribution where significant supply has moved recently without establishing long holding periods.

**High old band supply** demonstrates substantial unmoved Bitcoin, showing strong holder conviction where large amounts remain dormant for years, indicating patient capital and reduced circulating supply available for trading.

**Growing old band supply** reveals successful accumulation maturing into conviction as coins age into long-term bands without movement, strengthening supply stability through demonstrated holding commitment.

**Declining old band supply** signals long-term holder distribution as aged coins move and reset into young bands, often marking profit-taking events when patient capital breaks its holding commitment.

### Use Cases

This metric provides fundamental insight into holder composition and conviction through age-based supply distribution. High concentrations in old bands indicate networks dominated by long-term holders who demonstrate conviction through years of inactivity, strengthening supply fundamentals. These veteran holdings create reduced liquid supply as committed capital withdraws from active circulation. Conversely, high young band concentrations reveal active trading environments where supply frequently changes hands without establishing conviction. The metric identifies accumulation success by tracking supply migration from young to old bands, with steady old band growth confirming holders maintain positions and graduate into strong hands. During bear markets, rising old band percentages confirm accumulation is working as new buyers demonstrate conviction by holding through pain. During bull markets, tracking old band behavior identifies distribution intensity, with declining old bands warning that veterans are taking profits. The age distribution reveals holder quality, as sustainable bull markets show old bands maintaining or growing while unsustainable tops show massive old band declines from veteran distribution. Comparing distributions across cycles reveals whether current holder base demonstrates stronger or weaker conviction than historical precedent.
