# Long Term Holder SOPR

The **Long Term Holder SOPR** metric tracks the Spent Output Profit Ratio specifically for long-term holders (coins held 155+ days). {{ className: 'lead' }}

This metric reveals whether long-term holders are selling at profit or loss, providing insights into strategic holder behavior and identifying major market cycle turning points.

## Understanding the metric

<Row>
  <Col>

<Properties>
  <Property name="lth_sopr" type="number">
    The ratio of spent output value at spending time to creation time for
    long-term holders. Values above 1.0 indicate profit-taking, below 1.0
    indicate loss-taking.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Interpretation

**LTH-SOPR above 1.0** indicates long-term holders are spending coins at profit, suggesting distribution during bull markets or late-cycle profit-taking by patient holders who accumulated during previous bear markets.

**LTH-SOPR below 1.0** reveals long-term holders capitulating at losses, typically occurring only during severe bear markets when even patient holders lose conviction. This is extremely rare and often marks major market bottoms.

**LTH-SOPR significantly above 2.0** suggests long-term holders are taking substantial profits with 100%+ gains, often signaling late bull market phases where early accumulators distribute to new entrants at elevated prices.

**LTH-SOPR declining toward 1.0 during rallies** indicates long-term holders reducing distribution as they anticipate further upside, potentially signaling bull market continuation with strong holder conviction.

### Use Cases

This metric is one of the most powerful for identifying major market cycle turning points. Long-term holders represent the smartest money, having survived multiple cycles and typically buying low and selling high. When LTH-SOPR drops below 1.0, it signals extreme capitulation where even patient holders surrender, historically marking significant market bottoms. Conversely, extremely high LTH-SOPR values above 3.0-4.0 have preceded major tops as long-term holders distribute maximum profits. The metric helps distinguish healthy bull market corrections from bear market beginnings by showing whether long-term holders maintain conviction or start exiting. Sharp LTH-SOPR drops during uptrends can signal temporary corrections as profit-taking occurs, while gradual increases suggest steady distribution into strength. Comparing LTH-SOPR with overall SOPR reveals whether long-term strategic holders behave differently from short-term traders, providing insight into smart money versus speculative positioning.
