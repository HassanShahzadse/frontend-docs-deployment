# Spent Output Age Bands

The **Spent Output Age Bands** metric distributes spending activity across age cohorts, showing the volume of Bitcoin spent by different holder time horizons. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This metric reveals which holder cohorts are actively moving coins, distinguishing between short-term trader activity and long-term holder distribution through age-segmented spending analysis.

### Interpretation

**High short-term band spending** indicates active trading and frequent turnover among recent holders, revealing short-term speculation and rapid position changes typical during volatile periods or when new capital enters and exits quickly.

**High long-term band spending** demonstrates veteran holder distribution where coins held for years are moving, signaling potential market tops as patient capital that survived cycles decides to exit, often marking major distribution events.

**Rising long-term spending during rallies** warns of smart money distribution as experienced holders who accumulated at low prices take profits, often preceding corrections when this supply from strong hands overwhelms demand.

**Declining long-term spending during bear markets** indicates veteran holders maintaining positions despite pain, signaling confidence in eventual recovery and reducing available supply as committed capital refuses to capitulate at depressed prices.

### Use Cases

This metric provides essential insight into which holder cohorts are actively participating in markets, revealing the quality and conviction of supply entering circulation. High spending from short-term bands indicates active speculation and trading without significant conviction, as coins rapidly change hands among participants with short time horizons and limited attachment to positions. Conversely, elevated spending from long-term bands reveals committed capital finally distributing, which carries more significant implications as these holders demonstrated patience through volatility and their decision to exit suggests important conviction shifts. During bull markets, tracking long-term band spending intensity identifies distribution phases, with accelerating veteran holder exits often marking tops as smart money realizes gains accumulated over years. The metric also reveals market cycle characteristics, with healthy bull markets showing balanced spending across bands while unsustainable euphoric peaks show extreme long-term holder distribution. During bear markets, monitoring long-term band spending identifies capitulation intensity, with sustained veteran selling indicating distress while declining spending suggests capitulation exhaustion. Comparing spending patterns across cycles reveals whether current market structure differs from historical norms, with unusual patterns indicating potential regime changes or structural shifts in holder behavior. The metric also enables identification of dormant coin awakening events, where sudden spending from very old bands signals major holder decisions that can significantly impact markets given the large unrealized gains these positions typically hold.
