## Understanding the metric

<Row>
  <Col>

<Properties>
  <Property name="addresses_count_outflow" type="integer">
    The number of unique addresses withdrawing funds from the exchange during
    the specified time window.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Interpretation

- **Rising outflow addresses** → Increased withdrawal activity. May indicate **loss of confidence**, security concerns, or users moving to self-custody during market uncertainty.
- **Declining outflow addresses** → Reduced withdrawal activity. Users may be comfortable keeping funds on exchange or preparing for trading.
- **Sudden spike** → Potential panic event, security scare, or regulatory concerns prompting mass withdrawals.
- **Sustained high levels** → Long-term trend toward self-custody or migration to other platforms.

Compare with exchange reserves and netflow data to understand the complete picture of exchange health and user sentiment.
