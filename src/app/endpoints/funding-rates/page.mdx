# Funding Rates

## Understanding the metric

<Row>
  <Col>

<Properties>
  <Property name="funding_rates" type="number">
    The funding rate as a percentage. Positive values mean longs pay shorts
    (bullish sentiment), negative values mean shorts pay longs (bearish
    sentiment).
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Interpretation

**Positive funding rates** indicate bullish market sentiment where long positions dominate and traders are willing to pay to maintain leveraged long exposure. Higher positive rates suggest increasing bullish conviction but also overleveraged long positions vulnerable to liquidation cascades.

**Negative funding rates** reveal bearish market sentiment where short positions dominate and traders pay to maintain leveraged short exposure. Deeply negative rates suggest extreme bearishness but also overleveraged shorts that may fuel short squeezes.

**Extremely high positive rates (0.05%+)** signal excessive long leverage and potential market tops, as unsustainable funding costs eventually force longs to close positions, creating selling pressure and downward price action.

**Extremely negative rates (-0.05%+)** indicate excessive short leverage and potential market bottoms, as high costs force shorts to cover, creating buying pressure that can trigger powerful relief rallies or trend reversals.

### Use Cases

This metric is essential for identifying overleveraged market conditions and potential reversal points. Extremely high funding rates in either direction suggest unsustainable positioning that often precedes sharp corrections. Contrarian traders use extreme funding rates as reversal signals, betting against the overleveraged majority. Funding rate divergences across exchanges reveal arbitrage opportunities where traders can take opposing positions on different platforms. Sustained moderate positive rates during uptrends confirm healthy bullish sentiment without excessive leverage, while neutral or negative rates during rallies suggest accumulation by spot buyers rather than leverage-driven pumps. Tracking funding rate changes helps predict liquidation events, as rapid increases signal building leverage that may unwind violently. For risk management, high funding rates warn of unstable market conditions where cascade liquidations could trigger extreme volatility.
